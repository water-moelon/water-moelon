### WelcomeÔºÅ

Hi! I am Water Moelon! Someone who enjoy diving in any online talk.

I like to use open source programs. Programming is my extracurricular hobby, except that I learned a little Scratch in elementary school's information class and the "standard EXE" of Visual Basic in junior high school, I don't have a special class to learn programming languages.
